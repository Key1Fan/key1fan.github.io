Hi! I'm **Keyi Fan (樊珂伊)**, a Master in Public Policy (MPP) candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School with a background in economics and public policy from the University of Toronto.

My interests lie in development economics, environmental and urban policy, and the political economy of institutions and inequality. I’m currently developing research at the intersection of land use, environmental spillovers, and local governance.

I’ve presented work at the Canadian Economics Association (CEA) and the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE), and I continue to explore interdisciplinary projects that combine data, writing, and impact.

Outside of research, I love fieldwork-inspired essays, train station bookstores, and traveling with my father and our dog. 🐾
